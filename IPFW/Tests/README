Each of the subdirectories you find here contains a single, Conductor
based, test for use with a 3 host test rig.  One host
is the source of traffic, another is a sync, and the third is the 
device under test.  

Each test has four config files, three of which are used with
player, and the last of which is used with conduct.

source.cfg - the source host 
dut.cfg    - the host with the test kernel (Device Under Test)
sink.cfg   - the host catching packets as they pass through PF

test.cfg   - used with conduct on the controlling host
